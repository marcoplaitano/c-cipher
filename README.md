# C-CIPHER

A program to encrypt/decrypt a file using the **AES-CTR-256** cipher.

It can be used to store passwords (or any other kind of sensible information) 
locally, in a private way.  
The user only needs one password to both encrypt and decrypt the information.

## Details on Security

The algorithm is implemented in C, using the [OpenSSL]'s Encryption [API].

The **Encryption Key** has to be 256-bits long; it is generated by computing
`SHA256(p)`, with `p` being the user's password.<sup>[1](#f1)</sup>  
The same key is used for both encryption and decryption.

The _Initialization Vector IV_ is a string of `16` bytes.  
The last (**LSB**)<sup>[2](#f2)</sup> `8` bytes contain a counter which will be
incremented at every new encrypted block.  
The first (**MSB**) `8` bytes contain the "_nonce_": a random sequence of bits.  
When encrypting, the _nonce_ is filled with random bytes; these will be
prepended to the ciphertext in order to read them during the decryption
procedure.

The _block length n_, is an important parameter for determining the concrete
security of the cipher.  
Being the **IV** a uniform string of _n-bits_, it is expected to repeat after
having performed "only" `2`<sup>`n/2`</sup> encryptions.<sup>[3](#f3)</sup>  
In our case `n` is `128` bits; this means that only `2`<sup>`64`</sup> blocks -
or `2*10`<sup>`5`</sup> **Petabytes** - can be safely encrypted without ever
changing the `IV`.  
This is more than safe for a regular text file.

### Tampering

It must be noted that this mode of encryption provides no security against data
tampering.  
If the ciphertext were to be modified even by just one bit, the *integrity* of
the information would be lost.

The scope of this project however is to provide a trivial example of encryption,
to be used for simpler "protection" against *adversaries* who know little to
nothing about cryptography.

## Installation

Take a look at the [dependencies] listed below, needed to compile the program.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/marcoplaitano/c-cipher
cd c-cipher
make cipher
```

## Usage

```sh
./bin/cipher [in_file] [out_file] [mode] [password]
```

The program needs the following 4 command line arguments, in order:

+ `in_file`  
    Input file on which the cipher will be applied
+ `out_file`  
    Output file storing the result
+ `mode`  
    A string, either '**encrypt**' or '**decrypt**'
+ `password`  
    A string chosen by the user

_**Note:** using this approach means that anyone with access to the computer
can learn the password since it is stored in the shell's history.
A workaround might be requesting the 4 arguments **inside** the program, at
runtime._

### Example

The first time you run the program, the `in_file` should be the plain text file
containing the private information.  
The output file will store the encrypted version of it.

It is at this point that you must choose the **password** to use. It can contain
any ASCII character and can be of any (reasonable) length.

```sh
./bin/cipher input.txt private.dat encrypt myPassword_123
```

The following times, the plaintext version can be recreated with the command:

```sh
./bin/cipher private.dat output.txt decrypt myPassword_123
```

Notice how the two paths have been swapped, the mode is now **de**crypt and the
password remains the same.
